Use this comment in mongodb terminal to create database and create username and password

1)To create database
	use DBNAME
	
2)Create username and password for the above database you have created
	db.createUser({user:"USERNAME", pwd:"PASSWORD",roles:["readWrite","dbAdmin"]})
		
3)Use this comment to check if its successfull or not (It will return 1 if successfull otherwise 0)
	db.auth("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
